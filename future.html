        <h1> Ideas: </h1>
        <p class="lead"> This is an outline of ideas that could be implemented in the future. </p>

        <p>   Draw more cross sections through the model </p> 
        <p>   Add specific tectures and link all notes from students  </p>
        <p> create various other models that will have a different story </p>
        <p> Allow for a section in which one can leave comments</p> 


        <h2> Website: </h2>
          <p class="lead"> Moving forward, I hope that this website is used as a reference for the Diligencia Basin and other people find it helpful to the point where they contribute their own findings. There is also the hope that this website will provide a foundation for what other interactive websites in the geosciences will look like. </p>

       <h2> Modeling:</h2> 
         <p class="lead"> This model has been created for GEO 373, as a final project. It is still far from an exact model and has several hypotheses that are yet to be tested based on any additional evidence that can be gathered at the site of excavation. By conducting further studies and collecting more data, we will be able to build upon this existing model to create a more accurate representation. While there are limitations in the technology, we hope to continue to improve the model and make data accessible to everyone. </p>
          
         <h2> Combining Models:</h2> 
           <p class="lead"> Models of thousands of locations are constantly being updated by different groups of researchers. In the future, I hope that these models can all be synthesized and geo-referenced to their locations. With so much information in one palace, very accurate models of terrains can be made, which in cases like Polis, Cyprus, would be extremely valuable. This would also provide a foundation for an even greater project that would seek to bring it all together and create a 3D reality platform for all of these sites. By creating more digital terrains of varying models, there are numerous possibilities for what can follow. One that comes to mind consists of gauging the accuracy of measurments by comparing those of a variety of sources.</p>
          
          
         <h1> Future Work: </h1>

         <p class="lead">Future work will be needed in maintaining the usefullness of this website. We predict that the website and models will need to be constantly updated as new information emerges from any future studies of Diligencia Basin. </p>
