        <h1> Ideas: </h1>
        <p class="lead"> This is an outline of ideas that could be implemented in the future. </p>

        <p>   Draw more cross sections through the model </p> 
        <p>   Add specific tectures and link all notes from students  </p>
        <p> create various other models that will have a different story </p>
        <p> Allow for a section in which one can leave comments</p> 


        <h2> Website: </h2>
          <p class="lead"> Moving forward, I hope that this website is used and other people find it helpful to the point 
              where they add their own things. There is the hope that this website will provide a foundation for what other interactive websites in the geosciences will look like. </p>
        <src="img/b4.png" style="width: 300px" align="left"/>
           
       <h2> Modeling:</h2> 
         <p class="lead">By conducting surveys with instruments and collecting data, ...there will be a stronger foundation for continuing to build upon the existing model. The current model has 
         several hypothesis that are yet to be tested based on any additional evidence that can be gathered at the site
         of excavation. The model that has been created for GEO 373, as a final project. While there are limitations in 
          the technology, we hope to continue to improve the model and make data accessible to everyone. </p>
          
         <h2> Combining Models:</h2> 
           <p class="lead">With the constant updating of the models; it is desired that in the future something 
           can be created in which all the models are geo-referenced to their locations. With the geo-referenced 
           models it would be very useful to have a terrain that is true to the terrain of Polis, Cyprus; and it would
           be extremely valuable if all the models ever created from the excavation could all be placed onto this 
           geo-referenced terrain. This would provide a foundation for an even greater project that would seek to 
           bring it all together and create a 3-D reality platform for all of these sites. 
           By creating more digital terrains of varying models, there are numerous possibilities for what can follow--some that
           come to mind consist of figuring out how many people are getting the same measurements... </p>
          
          
         <h1> Future Work: </h1>
         <p class="lead">The team has managed to bring you a website  </p>

         <p class="lead">Future work will be needed in maintaining the website. We predict that the website will need to be
         constantly updated as new evidence emerges from any future excavations in B.F8/9. There is also a need to 
         update any artifacts from the tombs that are discovered in the future. 
         Any dates on this site are highly reliant on past published reports from the exaction; and therefore, if anything changes 
         in the known timeline, the website will also need to be updated. </p>
