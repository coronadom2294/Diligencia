        <h1> Ideas: </h1>
        <p class="lead"> Here we provide an outline for our ideas on where we see this project going, 
        and what is left to do on our part. </p>

        <p>   Place Objects in Model </p> 
        <p>   Add textures onto the objects  </p>
        <p> Implement realistic Lighting/Textures (from sun) & windows </p> 
        <p> Give the ability for one to be able to click on the floor plan in order to view certain areas of the model</p> 
        <p> View Modes:     Add selection,     Maybe have the ability to change based on the viewpoint </p> 
        <p> Add a terrain </p> 
        <p> Allow for a section in which one can leave comments</p> 


        <h2> Website: </h2>
          <p class="lead">In the future, there is a possibility that this website will become part of a larger
          project that will bring together all of the other buildings excavated in Polis, Cyprus--by doing so, 
          the Princeton Excavations are going to be greatly detailed. We hope that this website provides a 
          foundation for what other websites will look like. In the future, it is hoped that the website will
          continue to obtain evidence and continue to publish any future information from the excavations in Polis, Cyprus. </p>
        <src="img/Tower2.png" style="width: 300px" align="left"/>
           
       <h2> Modeling:</h2> 
         <p class="lead">By conducting surveys with instruments such as the Ground Penetrating Radar, Magnetometry, 
         or Electro-Resistivity Tomography on the Southwest and Southeast sides of B.F8/9 (and taking into account that they yield good results), 
         there will be a stronger foundation for continuing to build upon the existing model. The current model has 
         several hypothesis that are yet to be tested based on any additional evidence that can be gathered at the site
         of excavation. The model that has been created for B.F8/9 by the Princeton seminar class, COS496-HLS496_S2014 
         Special Topics in Computer Science: Modeling the Past: Digital Tech, and Excavations in Polis Cyprus, 
         is only a foundation for the work that is to come. In the future we hope to see the model be developed 
         into a layout that is more efficient and reflective of future evidence. </p>
         <h2> Combining Models:</h2> 
           <p class="lead">With the constant updating of the models; it is desired that in the future something 
           can be created in which all the models are geo-referenced to their locations. With the geo-referenced 
           models it would be very useful to have a terrain that is true to the terrain of Polis, Cyprus; and it would
           be extremely valuable if all the models ever created from the excavation could all be placed onto this 
           geo-referenced terrain. This would provide a foundation for an even greater project that would seek to 
           bring it all together and create a 3-D reality platform for all of these sites. 
           By creating this digital terrain of models, there are numerous possibilities for what can follow--some that
           come to mind consist of adding in all the artifacts that are found, and geo-referencing them in relation to 
           the models. Another idea deals with implementing the excavated tombs into the terrain. </p>
         <h1> Future Work: </h1>
         
         <p class="lead">The team has managed to bring you a website that not only shows you a model that has stayed 
         true to the floor plan of B.F8/9, but has also managed to make a clear distinction between the known and the
         unknown; what is left to do is to document the files used to create this model in great detail.
         The group plans to carry out this project in the coming weeks that are left of the class. 
         Once the project has been documented, the group wants combine the information into one directory that can 
         easily be made available to anyone in the future that wishes to work on this model.  </p>

         <p class="lead">Future work will be needed in maintaining the website. We predict that the website will need to be
         constantly updated as new evidence emerges from any future excavations in B.F8/9. There is also a need to 
         update any artifacts from the tombs that are discovered in the future. 
         Any dates on this site are highly reliant on past published reports from the exaction; and therefore, if anything changes 
         in the known timeline, the website will also need to be updated. </p>
