               <h2> Princeton Cyprus Expedition </h2> 
                    <p class="lead">Past excavations done by Princeton in the areas of B.F8, B.F9, B.C6, and B.D7 
                    unveiled a Cypro-Archaic public building, sanctuary, and some workshops as well as domestic structures.
                    The dating of these archaeological remains date from the Geometric period all the way back to the 
                    early Cypro-Classical period.</p>
                    <h2> Palace (B.F8/9) </h2> 
                    <p class="lead">"It was over the course of the seventh century, and probably in its second half,
                    that the city of Marion assumed a formal existence; until then, it has been proposed that the 
                    valley was a dependent of Paphos to the southwest. Around 600 b.c.e., it appears the whole site 
                    from east to west was gridded with a regular pattern of streets running north to south and
                    east to west. On the southeastern edge of Peristeries, in Area B.F8/9, a substantial, and 
                    apparently secular structure was built employing large ashlar blocks in the lower walls 
                    and mud brick above, but the character of these walls can be convincingly visualized only
                    by comparison with the preserved and impressive mud-brick foundation walls of Area E.G0. 
                    Although little pottery was collected from the rooms in Area B.F8/9, fragments of fine imported 
                    wares were found, and a small cistern produced almost complete local and imported storage vessels. 
                    These rooms around small courtyards, all with excellent concrete floors, probably served as the 
                    service wing of the building that stretched an unknown distance to the west under the recently 
                    constructed parking lot of the new elementary school. On the northern side of the building and
                    at a slightly lower level was a series of rooms, the walls of which were made exclusively of 
                    rough stones. Here one room was filled with storage amphora and another had a small furnace 
                    for working metal, constituting a storage and craft wing. In view of the size and fine construction
                    of the southern part of the building, it was nicknamed the "Palace." It seems likely that another
                    prominent building existed in the western part of Marion since an impressive Hellenistic building 
                    in Area E.G0 reused a great number of ashlar limestone blocks, several with Cypriot syllabic mason's
                    marks."</p>
                <h4> Tombs </h4>
                <p class="lead">"The general features of the tombs are standard: the tombs are dug into the sides of 
                the hills or sunk deep in the ground with long entrance ramps, or as a dromo. The earlier tombs have 
                a simple, single chamber that is roughly oval in shape. On occasion, there are niches in the dromos 
                that probably originally held offerings to the dead; in some cases, they may have held small sculptures.
                The later tombs are frequently notable for their greater size and sometimes impressive architectural forms,
                such as rectangular plans, cut stone walls, moldings, and roofs in the form of barrel vaults, which suggests, 
                as does so much else, a conspicuous prosperity in the later Classical period of the fourth century. 
                The early tombs frequently held multiple burials interred over an extended period of time, 
                but the early bodies and grave goods were simply pushed to the side to make room for the new arrival(s)
                with little or no decorum. Despite the size and wealth of the tombs, it appears that until the late 
                fifth century there were no markers set over them to proclaim the name(s) and virtues of the deceased. 
                Indeed, the graves of Marion reveal a rather special, not to say idiosyncratic, culture in the Chrysochou
                Valley that differed markedly from that of the other important centers on the island. 
                The numerous small blocks of limestone, usually with only a name carved in Cypriot syllabary, 
                were not used as visible markers above the tombs but have been found exclusively in the dromo or 
                in the actual tomb chambers. In the late sixth century b.c.e., a very particular type of vase 
                was also developed at Marion and remained popular into the fourth century: the one-handled jug or pitcher
                with one or more plastic figures on the shoulder. These, too, have been found almost exclusively in 
                either the dromos or the tomb chamber."</p>
                <p class="lead"> Collections of tombs can be found both buried beneath the palace hill and across 
                the palace on a neighboring hill. Tomb124A, which is the tomb found under the "Tomb" page was buried
                in the latter hill.</p>

                <h4> Sources: B.F8/9 Relationship to other Palaces </h4>
                <img src="img1/qgis.png" style=" width:50%" />
                <p class="lead"> Expert of the site B.F8/9, Nassos--"emphasize[s] the extensive and solid usage 
                of ashlar masonry types with close parallels in the nearby palace at Vouni.
                Likewise, equally impressive is the ample use of solidly constructed lime-base concrete for floors,
                a feature paralleled against Vouni, but also at Amathus and Idalion. 
                Moreover,  on the basis of the palace at Vouni it is possible that some of the eastern rooms were 
                arranged around an open courtyard. In other words, we are here confronted with an extensive building 
                complex, the main core of which was steadily built with state-of-the-art construction materials 
                (ashlar blocks, concrete pavements, plastered walls) and techniques. It is therefore tempting to 
                suggest that the massing of this building was intentionally calumnious and befits an architecture 
                conceived to visually punctuate the material configuration of centralized power.
                To be sure, this structure lacks the sophistication in pan and construction of the palace at Vouni,
                or the evidence for storage of surplus or for manufacture of luxury products discovered at the Archaic palace 
                of Amathus. Nevertheless, it is tempting to propose that it was a local seat of power, 
                perhaps the seat of the dynasty that ruled the integrated state of Marion in the Archaic and Classical 
                periods. This interpretation is certainly tentative, yet it underpinned by certain preliminary 
                considerations regarding its actual and symbolic contexts and its structural sophistication"(Papalexandrou, 2006).
                        Furthermore, the site was pillaged--and thus a lot of the ashlar blocks were robbed--this in turn has 
                        limited the amount of evidence avaible from the excavations. </p> 
                
                <h4> Construction</h4>
                <p class="lead">Cyprus has fame for being a place in which the ground is filled with history;
                because of this, there is an ongoing battle between the Department of Antiquities and the residents of 
                Cyprus. The Department of Antiquities serves as a method of preserving any ancient artifacts 
                that are present in Cyprus. Because of this, the Department of Antiquities has found itself on 
                multiple occasions as the barrier between an ancient history and a future construction that is highly
                dependent on monetary gains--thus, this has pushed for the future construction to at 
                times be very alarming. Unfortunately, the site of B.F8/9 has been subject to damages because 
                of the construction that has been attempted on the area before any preservation of the site could
                be accomplished. </p>
