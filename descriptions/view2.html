                <p> Most of what we can see today are concrete floors, ashlar blocks, mudbrick, and limestone.  "This wall (we are facing) features finely carved ashlar blocks of the white, fine-grained limestone of Polis, whereas its inner side is lined with tightly packed fieldstone's bound together with clay. This system of construction occurs throughout the surviving extent of the wall, except for the parts that form the east walls of Rooms 3 and 5"  (Papalexandrou, 2006) </p>

    			<h4> Peristeries Plateau</h4>
    			<p> Pictured is the the Plateau on which B.F8/9 sits; furthermore, "every since the nineteenth century, the Peristeries plateau has been known as the site of the ancient settlement of Marion, mainly on the basis of the adjacent groups of tombs that were found spread to the east and southeast of the eastern edge of the plateau"  (Papalexandrou, 2006). </p>

                <h4>Textual Evidence: Use of space</h4>
                <p> "The results of ground-based remote sensing (magnetometric prospection conducted in 2000) of the whole plateau indicate the existence of some kind of "zoning" or grid of streets, but the precise positioning of the structure at hand in relationship to this grid is still unclear" (Papalexandrou, 2006). </p>

 <h4>Textual Evidence: Peristeries Plateau (Continued)</h4>
    <p>The discovery of this structure that appears to be strategically located on the Peristeries plateau [B.F8/9] has brought "the first substantial evidence for habitation at Peristeries dating to the Archaic period" (Papalexandrou, 2006).</p>    		
<p>Pictured is the the Plateau on which B.F8/9 sits; furthermore, "every since the nineteenth century, the Peristeries plateau has been known as the site of the ancient settlement of Marion, mainly on the basis of the adjacent groups of tombs that were found spread to the east and southeast of the eastern edge of the plateau"(Papalexandrou, 2006).</p>
