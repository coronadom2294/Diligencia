             <p>   In this room, there was a concrete floor. The outer wall was foundation had solid ashlar blocks throughout, which were fit tightly together.  (Papalexandrou, 2006) </p>

    			<h4> Hypotheses About Use </h4>
            <p>    A water outlet (a u-shaped drain) was found in the outer wall, and there was a quadrent-shaped concrete basin was found in a corner of the room. This suggests the use of the room perhaps as a bath room or room for making wine. </p>
