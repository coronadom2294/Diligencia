                <p> A rectangular base was found in this area with a "very carefully carved rectangular cutting on top for the 
                insertion of a stone object, perhaps a stele or an architectural member. The latter function is suggested 
                by the fact that this base is aligned with an identical one which was discovered in place 3.50m. 
                further south. Both bases define a line that runs parallel to the foundation of the NS wall two metres
                to the west." (Papalexandrou, 2006) Based on the textual evidence we can surmise that
                perhaps that what is being detailed is the foundations of pillars for a covered portico. </p>
