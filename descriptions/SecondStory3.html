    			<h2 id="description_title">Second Story Hypothesis 3</h2>
    		<p>Once again, following the understanding that this is hypothetical and that we are correlating the widths of the walls to a hypothetical second story, we also developed this visual representation. As noticed, this particular hypothesis does not show the second story completely circulating the outer-courtyard, but rather wrapping around and coming to a halt before completely closing together. The reason we did this was to gain a better insight of how the space could be used with minor differences.</p>
