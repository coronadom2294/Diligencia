    			<h4> Separate Room </h4>

    	<p>As seen in this hypothesis, we have decided to separate the particular part from the rest of the building.
    	This approach was devised with the understanding that a metallurgical installation would produce smoke,
    	and thus it did not seem to be ideal to have such an inconvenient structure directly attached to the main building.
    	Thus the idea of a separate metal shop came to mind; and based on that idea we developed a hypothesis that would 
    	illustrate this.</p>
