<p>This two-colored vase features a short, cylindrical neck, an oval body, and two horizontal handles.  
The vase was decorated with stripes of bands and circles; a common feature of pottery found in the area.
  As can be seen in the photograph, the missing part of the rim was filled in with plaster.
