                <h4>Symmetry</h4>

<p>                    This western side of the building was made to be symmetrical to the eastern side.
For the scale of the uncertain rooms, we found the dimensions of room ten (8.2 sq m), room one (11.78 sq m), and room two
(20.96 sq m); we then took the average: which resulted in being 13.65 sq m. This quantitative approach provided us with a 
better understanding that each of the three rooms in the Southwestern section is 13.65 sq m.
