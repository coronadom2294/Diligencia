                <h4>Symmetry and Doors</h4>

     <p>               This western side of the building was made to be symmetrical to the eastern side. For the scale of the uncertain rooms, we found the dimensions of rooms ten (8.2 sq m), one (11.78 sq m), two (20.96 sq m), and took the average: 13.65 sq m. So, each of the three rooms in the Southwestern section is 13.65 sq m.
</p>

    <p> In addition to the symmetry of the rooms, in this hypothesis, we also looked for symmetry with door positions, so that the doors in the SW section are right across from the doors in the more known SE section. </p>
