    			<h2 id="description_title">Roof Hypothesis 3</h2>
    			<p>During the modeling process, it was interesting to note that the article made several references to
    			the palace at Vouni, thus while modeling we wanted to make sure that we provided as many viewpoints 
    			as possible. Because this building has never been modeled before, it was extremely important that we 
    			highlighted exactly what was known and unknown. Thus, because of lack of archaeological evidence, 
    			the roofing of the structure remains unknown--to take it a step further, 
    			there is a limitation on how much we actually know because as mentioned in the "Report of the Department of Antiquities, Cyprus 2008" much of the site has been pillaged of its materials. 
    			As a result, determining things --like what type of roof or how it was configured-- is at times impossible because of the 
    			    missing archaeological evidence.</p>
  
<h4>Why a Flat Roof?</h4>
<p>Since no roof tiling was found, it can be inferred that the roof was made of perishable material such as weed or straw,
possibly in a thatched manner.  The flat hypothesis was strengthened upon learning that other large palaces (such as Vouni)
also had flat roofs.</p>
