    			<h2 id="description_title">Southwestern Section</h2>
                 <br/>
                <p> This section of .B.F8/9 has yet to be excavated, so we do not have a clear understanding of what lays beneath the surface. As shown in the model, there is a parking lot that is part of the newly constructed elementary school of the town, 
                and thus a proper analysis of this particular area has yet to be implemented. 
                In the modeling, this area is unknown, and it is important to keep in mind that in order to recreate this section, 
                we compared it with the Southeast side of the building; thus that part of the model is completely based on the dimensions that we do have available for the southeast side, and takes into account what the dimensions and layout for the southwest side looked like. </p>

                <p> The model of the palace was based on the floor plan from the excavation site, and augmented with various hypotheses for the
                unknown sections. </p>
