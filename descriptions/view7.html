    			<h4> Second Story</h4>
                <p> While there was no direct evidence for a second story, the thick wall so the inner courtyard suggest that they could have supported a second story.</p>

                <h4> Continuation of Second Story:</h4>
                <p> With that in mind; the team that was in charge of modeling B.F8/9 decided to take an interesting approach in order to try to better understand the different possibilities for the structure's roof. Furthermore, we found it interesting that the walls on the known foundation were rather thick at certain points (directly around the foundation of the outer courtyard). Thus, we decided to make a model that would hypothetically take into consideration the wall size in direct correlation to the height of the building. This was done while taking into account other administrative buildings such as those found at Vouni, Amathus and Idalion. With those key factual elements, we ended up constructing a hypothetical visual representation of a second story onto B.F8/9. Once again, the different roofings and second stories depend on the idea of correlating the width of walls to the height (a lot of these proportions are referenced back to Vouni). That said, as scaled from the master plan we found that the outer courtyard walls ranged from 1m to 2m in width.</p>
