    			<h2 id="description_title">Second Story Hypothesis 1</h2>
    			<p>Once again, following the understanding that this is hypothetical, 
    			and that we are correlating the widths of the walls to a predicted 
    			second story, we also developed this visual representation. As noticed,
    			this particular hypothesis shows the thick wall between the two courtyards
    			to be the same height as the second story.  Thus, although the second story completely 
    			circulates the outer-courtyard, humans would not be able to go directly from the northwest 
    			to the northeast.  The reason we did this was to gain a better insight of how the space could 
    			be used with minor differences.</p>
