    			<h4> View from Entrance of Courtyard </h4>
                <p>The inner courtyard is most likely outlined by rooms or walls on all four sides as opposed to the larger, more open courtyard that sits behind this view.  This closed off courtyard adds to privacy; perhaps the rooms in this courtyard were private quarters for the royalty.</p>
 <p> This privacy conjecture is strengthened by the thick wall that rests behind us and in between the two courtyards.</p>
