    			<h4> Description </h4>
                    <p> Each of these three rooms featured a concrete floor. Room three was by far the highest best floor found during the excavation--it is a lot better quality than the floors found in room one and two.</p>

                <h4> Textual Evidence: </h4>
              
<p> These rooms were "covered with concrete floors of very good quality, which in general would have withstood the passage of time very well. In all areas of the building the concrete floors are laid out after the construction of the walls. This is evident in the edges of the concrete that are slightly curved up to mediate the  transition from the floor to the wall"  (Papalexandrou, 2006). </p>			</div>
