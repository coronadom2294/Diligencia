    			<h4> What Can Be Seen Today? </h4>
    			<p> Pictured below is an ariel view of the location of the "Palace" (B.F8/9); 
    			you may note that certain parts still need to be excavated. To the left a model 
    			has been created in order to give a visual representation of what is known from 
    			the excavated area of the site.</p>

                <h4> B.F8/9 "Palace" Floor Plan </h4>
                <p> Presented is a model created based on the master floor plan from the Princeton Excavation of 
                the area B.F8/9; the model was intended for the purpose of providing a visual representation of the known,
                the unknown, and the uncertain. 
                
                Furthermore, in order to provide an interpretation for areas of B.F8/9 that are unknown or questionable,
                elements of what is known have been taken into account in order to help make a prediction on how certain
                parts of B.F8/9 might have looked like--thus our hypothesis represent an interpretation of what we think
                could have been possible, keep in mind that these are hypothetical. </p>
