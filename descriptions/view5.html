    			<h2 id="description_title">Inside Inner Courtyard</h2>
                <h4> Walls </h4>
                <p> The walls surrounding the inner courtyard are surprisingly thick: they measure 1.5 to 2 meters. The height of the walls in our model are around 2.5 meters; this hypothetical height was based on the comparison to Vouni and the B.D7 wall fall.</p>
                
                <h4> Windows </h4> 
                <p> Another question is whether the inner courtyard held windows into each of the rooms.  This would allow more sunlight to enter the east and west side rooms, but they would take away some privacy from the rooms.  As the walls are so thick, it seems that privacy and security, or holding up a second story, would be more important than the sunlight and openness that would come from the windows. Thus, this model does not show windows.</p>
