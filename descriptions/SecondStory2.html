    			<!--<h4> Basic Facts </h4> -->
    			<p>Once again, following the understanding that this is hypothetical and that we are correlating the widths of the walls to a hypothetical second story, we also developed this visual representation. As noticed, this particular hypothesis does not show the second story completely circulating the outer-courtyard, but rather wrapping around and coming to a halt before completely closing together. The reason we did this was to gain a better insight of how the space could be used with minor differences. </p>

                <h4> The Palace Floor Plan </h4>
                <p> The model of the palace was based on the floor plan from the excavation site, and augmented with various hypotheses for the
                unknown sections. </p>
