                <h4> Gate </h4>
               
                <p> The gate acts as a passageway between the thick dividing wall of the inner and outer courtyard. 
                This one passageway along with the thickness of the wall perhaps signifies that the inner courtyard 
                was a private space for the higher elite.</p>
