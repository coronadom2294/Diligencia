<h2> Roof Hypothesis 2 </h2>
<p>During the modeling process, it was interesting to note that the article made several references to the palace at Vouni,
thus while modeling we wanted to make sure that we provided as many viewpoints as possible. 
Because this building has never been modeled before, we found it extremely important that we highlight exactly
what is known and unknown. Thus, as seen in our model, the roofing of the structure is not known--limitations have been 
put on how much we actually known because as mentioned in the "Report of the Department of Antiquities, Cyprus 2008" 
much of the site was pillaged of its materials. Thus, determining things like what type of roof, how it was configured 
etc. at times is unknown for the site.</p>
  
<h4>Why a Flat Roof?</h4>
<p>Since no roof tiling was found, it can be inferred that the roof was made of perishable material such as weed or straw,
possibly in a thatched manner.  The flat hypothesis was strengthened upon learning that other large palaces (such as Vouni)
also had flat roofs.</p>
