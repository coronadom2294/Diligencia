    			<h2 id="description_title">Second Story Hypothesis 5</h2>
    <p>This next hypothesis was derived by taking into account a temple called "Temple A1" in Tell Afis (Israel). This temple is described by Stephania Mazzoni in the journal Near Eastern Archaeology, vol. 77.1 (2014). Furthermore, Mazzoni discusses a temple that appears to be related to the plan of B.F8/9 or "the Palace." Her article provided a reconstruction of this building at a much earlier stage; yet we based this particular hypothesis on her reconstruction of the two towers for Temple A1--just like her model, our hypothesis includes two towers on either side of the entrance. We decided to portray this based on the fact that the plans are similar, but also with the idea that two units on either side of the gate that leads to the inner courtyard could be more monumental in character. This makes our model more pronounced at the gate, and thus bringing forth the concept of power in relationship to the space of B.F8/9.</p>
