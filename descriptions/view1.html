    			<h4> Current Site </h4>
                <img src="img/excavation.png" alt="Current Site" width="80%">
                <p> The site of exaction provided evidence for the boundaries of rooms in the B.F8/9 structure; and the evidence highly suggests a clear arrangement of these rooms and a well-defined courtyard. Furthermore, in reference to the report by Nassos Papalexandrou, as well as the 2006 exploration of B.F8/9 , "no new evidence came to light corroborating or disproving the author's hypothesis that this building [B.F8/9] functioned as a local administrative center or "palace"â€¦and the excavation in 2006 affirmed once more the substantial size of this building, whose original extend and overall layout still remain unknown" (Papalexandrou, 2008).</p>

    			<h4> The Palace Floor Plan </h4>

                <p> The master floor plan provides a clear understanding of what was found at the B.F8/9 excavation site. Thus, in relation to actual measurements and topographical features of the area, "the building [B.F8/9] is located 1km. east of the urban center of Polis," and "the western edge of the excavated area [b.f8/9] is at a distance of 37m. east of the newly constructed Elementary School of the town and ca 153m. north of the main artery linking Polis with major settlements to the northeast"  (Papalexandrou, 2006). </p>
