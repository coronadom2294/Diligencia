                <p> A well-built cistern was found in the south side of Room 8.  The cistern was probably first used as a water container; but then pottery was found thrown in during the usage of the palace.  The presence of a cistern indicates this portion of the building was a place of residence. </p>

<p>"At the south edge of this room is a well-constructed cistern ca 3.45m deep, which points to the utilitarian nature of this wing of the building. This was hewn out of the soft bedrock of this area and was coated with lime-cement"  (Papalexandrou, 2006)</p>
<p>  All of the pottery from the 2003 excavation was found in this cistern.  To see the pottery, click on the “Objects” page and locate the palace. </p>
